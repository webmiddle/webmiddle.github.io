### Filtering and merging

-   **Filter<br />
    **The filtering uses a conservative approach, i.e. it doesn’t
    exclude articles if they have incomplete information, for example an
    article with no publication year won’t be excluded even if there is
    a startYear and/or endYear input property.

-   **Merge**<br />
    Note that we don’t override existing values if the new values are
    null.<br />
    In fact, it might happen for certain properties to appear in the
    SearchArticles but to be undefined in the ArticleDetails, e.g. for
    the article category; in such a case, we don’t want to override our
    already valid information with an invalid information.

-   **MergeArticles<br />
    **As we said, is the final step in the whole search, it just
    concatenates the lists of articles from the various sites into a
    single list, by adding the **source** property to every article.
