### Site handler

A site handler is defined as a webmiddle having a **name**, **components**
and **settings**.

The project expects three **components** from each site handler: Meta,
SearchArticles and ArticleDetails.

Here is how the foxnews.com site handler is defined:

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'foxnews.com',
  settings: parentConfig,
  components: {
    Meta,
    SearchArticles,
    ArticleDetails,
  },
};
```

The **settings** is just the object we previously saw:

```javascript
export default {
  resultsPerPage: 10,
};
```
