Site webmiddles
---------------

In this **first section of the case study** we will focus on the lower
level of a webmiddle application: the site webmiddles.

Objective of a **site webmiddle** is to perform the smallest possible
numbers of steps to transform a website into a semantic source of data.

The ideal intended approach is for the **open source** community to
write site webmiddles that can then be reused in other projects, thus a
site webmiddle should be general enough to include all the pages of the
target website.

If the website already offers an **API**, then it is enough to just wrap
that API, as we will see with NyTimes, which offers an API for searching
article metadata.

In case of just HTML pages or other “raw” sources of data,
**converters** can be used to transform such data into a semantic format
of choice.

Here we will do a **simplification** for practical reasons: instead of
writing a service for every page of the websites, we will focus just on
those two pages required for the actual news search application:

-   **ArticleDetails**: is the article page containing all the data
    about a **single** article, including its full text.

-   **SearchArticles**: the search page containing a list of metadata
    about articles that pass the given search query.
