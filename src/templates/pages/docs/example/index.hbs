Example: News Search
=======================

In this section we'll see a step-by-step example on how to build a search application for news articles.

It will query some popular news sites, some returning raw HTML, other exposing JSON APIs, and will convert such heterogeneous data into the same JSON format. This homogeneous JSON can then be furtherly processed to filter / merge results, in order to only keep the articles that match the search options specified by the user (query, publication year range, etc.). 

As first step, we'll create the webmiddles for the individual news sites, then we'll move to the more general part of the application, when the articles from each sites are filtered and merged into the final output.
