### CookieManager

Differently from all the other packages that we will see, this is the
only one that is not a service.

It is a wrapper on top of the **[tough-cookie](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie)** library and it acts as a
cookie jar.

It is **shared** among all the webmiddle instances and can be used by
services such as HttpRequest and Browser to store and retrieve cookies.

This package makes sure that cookies can be preserved and shared when
using different services and different webmiddles.
