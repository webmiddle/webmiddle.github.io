### HttpRequest

Service built on top of the **request** library, it is used to perform
http requests.

It uses the CookieManager for storing and retrieving cookies.

The **request body** can be specified either directly as a string or as
a JSON object, in the latter case it will be converted to a string by
the service.

The **body conversion** to string depends on the ‘Content-Type’ http
header, if it is set to “application/json”, then the body will be
JSON-stringified, otherwise the default
“application/x-www-form-urlencode” content type is assumed, thus the
body will be converted to form data.

The service resolves with the **response body** wrapped in a resource,
whose name and contentType must be specified as attributes.

If the contentType attribute is set to “application/json”, then the
content will be JSON-parsed, otherwise it will be kept as is.

In case of **http error**, the service fails with an **HttpError
object** containing the error status code.

The service sets the “**retries**” options as the one set in the
“network.retries” webmiddle setting. This way such number can be
configured at application/webmiddle level:

```javascript
HttpRequest.options = ({ webmiddle }) => ({
  retries: webmiddle.setting('network.retries'),
});
```
