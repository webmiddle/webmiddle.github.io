Introduction
============

WebMiddle is a JSX-driven Node.js framework for extracting, transforming and processing web data from multiple heterogeneous sources, using a multi-layer approach, where each web middleware, or **webmiddle**, abstracts one or more sources of data, so to produce a structured output with the format of your choice, that can be then consumed by the higher-level middleware.

Each web middleware is implemented via JSX services, leading to a highly composable, extensible and declarative approach.

The idea is to provide an easy to use and structured way for solving
this class of problems, without compromising on the expressiveness and
quality of the solutions.

The choice of using multiple web middlewares has been made for tackling
the reuse problem: the idea is for the **open source** community to be
able to create and share web middlewares for the most common sites and
projects, so that they can be reused by other developers.

The framework is written in **JavaScript** and executed with **NodeJS**
, which allows to use the **JSX** technology, which roughly could be
described as a way of embedding XML-like documents into JavaScript
files, with the added benefit of being able to embed and reference
JavaScript expressions into these XML-like documents.

Every aspect of a webmiddle application can be written by means of JSX
trees, from the http requests, to the conversion steps, to the business
logic.

A JSX tree is a tree whose nodes have attributes and a type, where the
type can reference a function, here called **service**.

This allow the user to define in a **tree-like fashion** the logic of
the application, in a declarative and modular approach.

The ability of embedding JavaScript into the JSX tree, the ability of
using functions as the element types, and finally the ability for the
user to define its own functions, make for many possibilities in the
kind of applications that can be developed.

Note that JSX is mainly a way of defining **React** components, but it
is developed in such a way that it can be transpiled to any tree format
at build time, thanks to libraries such as **Babel**.

In the framework, the JSX is **transpiled** into its more general
format, a “**virtual tree**”, or simply “**virtual**”, i.e. a node with
a type, attributes and children. This virtual tree is then evaluated
accordingly.

Moreover, the framework provides a set of **core services** for the most
common operations: http requests, data conversion, flow control, PhantomJS requests,
concurrency and error handling, to name a few.
