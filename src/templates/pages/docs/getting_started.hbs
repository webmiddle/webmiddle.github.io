Getting started
============

The quickest way to create a new webmiddle application is to use the yeoman generator.<br />
First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [generator-webmiddle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-webmiddle) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-webmiddle
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo webmiddle
```

The created application already includes as dependencies all the core webmiddle components.

### Build

To build the application (compiles JSX/ES6 via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

To rebuild on every file change use:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

### Test

For running tests execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

If you want to execute tests on every file change run:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Tests use [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

### Execute

The compiled files are stored in the `dist/` folder.
To execute the application, just run the following:

```bash
node dist
```

This will run the index.js file.

The generated application executes a [simple component](https://github.com/webmiddle/generator-webmiddle/blob/master/generators/app/templates/src/FetchPageLinks.js) by reading props from command line arguments,
example:

```bash
node dist "https://news.ycombinator.com/" "javascript"
```

This will spawn an headless browser on the given url (first argument) and will extract as JSON all the links whose text matches the provided query (second argument).
You can also specify an optional query selector (third argument) to be waited for, in case the page is dynamically loaded via JavaScript.

Now you can start messing around by changing `src/index.js` and by adding new components. Congratulations!
